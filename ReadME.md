## My process
as i begun, itried to visualize the areas grids can be applied. ie grouped items and itself as a whole to the body. By inspecting, i would emulate the grid layout and play around with the different no of columns or rows. After that, i css from top to bottom as guided.

### Built with

### What I learned

                -use grid shorthands
                -use flex within grid containers



### Continued development

In the next project ill expound on grid to advanced grid and flexbox
